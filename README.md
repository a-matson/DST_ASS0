* Geraint

We have an equal equity split between everyone.

## Reading order and requirements

All report content is in directory:
* report/

The report takes the following structure:
* 01-General_research.ipynb
* 02-Breast_cancer_visualisation.ipynb
* 03-Breast_cancer_model_comparison.ipynb
* 04-Breast_cancer_SVC_ANN.ipynb
* 05-Diabetes_DataCleaning.ipynb

Requirements for Python code are in `requirements.txt`.

## Evidence

Our working is shown in our own directories. We all performed our own general research of health and medical data with code examples. Geraint worked on data visualisation of breast cancer dataset; Ethan did further EDA and model comparison of breast cancer dataset; Andre focused on SVC and ANN models for breast cancer dataset; and Josh did data cleaning and analysis of a diabetes dataset.
