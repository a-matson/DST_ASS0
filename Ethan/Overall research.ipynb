    "I found a number of good websites with lots of datasets and/or code within the context of health/medical data. In particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. UCI ML Repo (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)\n",
    "2. Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/)\n",
    "3. GitHub\n",
    "4. https://paperswithcode.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "There were also some more specialised resources, such as:\n",
    "* MedMNISTv2 (https://medmnist.com/ )\n",
    "* OpenNEURO (https://openneuro.org/)\n",
    "* Public health records (https://data.cdc.gov/ and https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/?redirect=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "We were able to find these through online lists like:\n",
    "* https://deepchecks.com/10-best-free-healthcare-datasets-for-machine-learning/\n",
    "* https://github.com/topics/covid-19\n",
    "* https://github.com/beamandrew/medical-data \n",
    "\n",
    "### Other resources\n",

    "* https://medium.com/@natashanewbold/a-data-analytics-project-with-python-17614afa956b\n",
    "\n",
    "There are tonnes of academic papers and journals in this area, providing either general overviews of how data science can work best in a health/medical setting, or presenting novel data science/ ML techniques for solving a more specific problem. Here are a few we found:\n",

    "    * Easy to share/access code libraries online \n",
    "* Limiting \n",
    "    * Cannot collaborate simultaneously online \n",
    "    * Only saves audit history if you pushed the changes, otherwise are lost – no autosave \n",
    "    * Can be overly complex/confusing and run into annoying bugs easily\n",
    "    * Can run into more issues when trying to work online on Noteable and sync the work between local system and home Git repo... data duplication"
